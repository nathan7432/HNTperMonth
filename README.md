# HNTperMonth

A very simple program that calls the Helium API to see how much HNT was minted per month since the gensis block. This is helpful to how close helium is to reaching its 5 million HNT per month goal.

At the time of writing this goal has only been hit once due to techincal limitations of the RPis that the blockchain is run on.
